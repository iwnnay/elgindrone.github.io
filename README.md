# Elgin Drone | Aerial Photography

This is my personal bio and business page for my work as a drone pilot. I'm
one man trying to start up my business and am pursuing as many avenues as
possible when it comes to construction, real estate, promotional videos and
whatever is required of starting a business doing this thing I love.

# Jekyll Project

This a project using the jekyll ruby gem for static website development. It has
been a great experience and I look forward to continuing work with it. I think
there is a small expample of everything that one can do with Jekyll.rb within
my site.

# GitHub.io

My site is hosted through github.io for the time being. It was very easy to setup
and maintain. If you're curious, the `www.elgindrone.com` alias is handled by my
DNS settings. It could have just as easily been part of my CNAME file.
